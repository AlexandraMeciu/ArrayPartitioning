# ArrayPartitioning
Divide a given array of numbers into two subarrays such that the absolute difference between their sums is the smallest possible. For example, the array [2, 5, 4, 7, 15, 20] can be divided into subarrays [15, 7, 4] and [20, 5, 2]. The difference between the sums of those arrays is 1, and it is the smallest.
The sum of the first subarray is 26, the sum of the second subarray is 27, the difference is 1
